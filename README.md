# Minesweeper.js
A simple [Minesweeper](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minesweeper_(video_game)) game built using vanilla JavaScript

Current board size is 10x10 but it will parametrized in the future (probably). The amount of mines by default is equal to 10. 

The [flood fill](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flood_fill) algorithm is used to reveal empty cells that do no have any adjacent cells which are the bees.

Also, it would be nice to rewrite Prototype-style functions in EcmaScript 6+.

### Features to add:
- [ ] Set the mines number
- [ ] Set the board size
- [ ] Set flags
